My name is Axel Rivera, a cyclist and software developer living in Orlando, Florida.
I have over 10 years of experience building iOS apps in an enterprise environment including
tech startups, banks, government and health care. Now I mostly freelance to support working on my iOS apps.

I started cycling in May 2020, during the pandemic, after sitting on the couch for 20 years.
Although I initially struggled, I fell in love with the sport and now ride about 100 miles per week.
I can ride more, but successfully balancing work and hobbies is a skill that I haven't mastered yet.
