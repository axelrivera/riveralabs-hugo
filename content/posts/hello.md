Hi there,

My name is Axel Rivera. I'm an indie iOS developer living in Orlando, FL. I have over 10 years of experience building
iOS apps in an enterprise environment including tech startups, banks, government and health care. Now I mostly
freelance to support working on my iOS apps.

This blog is a place for me to cover topics about iOS development. While some of the content will be technical,
my true mission extends beyond code. I want to help other indie developers succeed in building amazing iOS apps, by
sharing insights, tools and my own battle stories.

Welcome aboard!
